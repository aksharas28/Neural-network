# Neural-network
Classification and Performance of neural network and convolutional neural network on Fashion-MNIST Data

Tools used: Jupyter Notebook:

Languages Used: Python
Libraries Used: Scikit-Learn, NumPy, Pandas, Keras, Neural Network

Implemented a single layer hidden layer neural network in Python from scratch. Secondly, a multi-layer Neural network is built with Keras Library. Finally, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is implemented with Keras Library. In the end, a comparison of Loss, Accuracy, Confusion Matrix for each classifier is made and relative strengths and weakness is observed.
